# Warman-Attempts  
A personal archive of my attempts at the **Warman Design & Build Competition** — a mix of CAD, coding, prototyping, assembly and debugging.  
This repository documents the journey of retrying a subject I originally struggled with, and turning it into a self-driven engineering challenge while still at uni.

---

## Overview  
The Warman competition is iconic at many engineering schools, but it’s also chaotic — tight deadlines, weird constraints, uncertain mechanisms, and a lot of trial and error.  
I didn’t perform well the first time I took the subject, so this repo is my way of giving myself a second chance:

- to redo the engineering properly,  
- to understand what I missed,  
- and to build something functional just for the sake of learning.

This repository is basically an **amateur robotics festival**: full of experiments, dead-ends, successes, mistakes, and real engineering thought processes.

---

## Purpose  
This repo exists because I wanted to:

- revisit the Warman challenge with more experience  
- document my engineering process honestly (including failures)  
- improve my CAD and mechanical design skills  
- practice coding embedded systems  
- test realistic assembly workflows  
- debug like crazy and learn from it  
- create a reference for others doing the subject in future  

It’s not a polished competition robot — it’s a *learning project*.

## What’s Inside  

### CAD + Mechanical Design  
- Early sketches and feasibility tests  
- Mechanisms that worked  
- Mechanisms that did *not* work  
- Assembly considerations  
- Prototype versions  
- Notes on design decisions and lessons learned  

### Coding  
- Embedded control attempts  
- Quick scripts for testing sensors  
- Motor control experiments  
- Timing, state machines, and “why isn’t this working” moments  

### Electronics  
- Rough wiring diagrams  
- Motor driver setup  
- Sensor trials  
- Debugging notes and magic smoke prevention  

### Prototyping & Assembly  
- Printed parts  
- Hardware testing  
- Integration runs  
- Photos and logs  
- Fixes and patches  

### Debugging  
Probably the most honest section of all.  
Expect:  
- miscalculations  
- mistakes  
- fixes  
- better fixes  
- interesting failures  
- unexpected successes

## Repository Structure  
```

/cad            SolidWorks files, sorted by year
README.md       Documentation

```

## Motivation  
Failing something isn’t fun, but turning it into a long-term learning project is honestly one of the most rewarding things you can do.  
This repo tracks that process — the determination to retry, get better, and treat the challenge as a real engineering problem rather than just an assignment.

---

## Future Plans  
- A fully functional Warman-style prototype (eventually)  
- Video documentation  
- More accurate CAD  
- Cleaner embedded code  
- A reproducible build guide  
- Post-mortem writeups for each subsystem
